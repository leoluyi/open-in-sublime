# Open in Sublime

> **Mac OS X Finder Toolbar symbol** to open current dir or selected item (dir or file) within Sublime Text 3

> **Heck, I'm ONLY compatible with Sublime Text 3!!!**

## Changes

* Edited `open in sublime.applescript` from `SublimeText2` to `SublimeText`.

## Building (README by [pjv](https://github.com/pjv/open-in-sublime/tree/f0bc39b2dc867ee515ca48599d9ba2cbabcba494))
If you want to turn this raw script into the equivalent of the application that is available for download from this repo's wiki, open it in applescript and then save as an application.

If you want it to look cool, cmd-i on the saved applet and cmd-i on Sublime Text 2 and copy the ST2 icon from ST2 to the applet.
